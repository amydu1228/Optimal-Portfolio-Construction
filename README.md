# Optimal-Portfolio-Construction

## Goal: 
The goal for this project is to optimize industry portfolios through maximizing Sharpe ratio or minimizing variance. 

* Sharpe Ratio
* Portfolio Allocation
* Portfolio Statistics
* Portfolio Optimization

## Step 1: Import Data from Kenneth French's Data Library
Gathered data from Kenneth French's data library, http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html.  
The Data Library contains current benchmark returns and historical benchmark returns data, which is convenient for financial modeling and data analysis.

## Step 2: Calculate the mean and variance of a portfolio
The return on the portfolio is the weighted sum of the individual stock returns

## Step 3: Portfolio Optimization Based on Maximum Sharpe Ratio

### Scenario 1: For Long Only

### Scenario 2: Allow Short Selling

## Step 4: Portfolio Optimization Based on Minimum-Variance
