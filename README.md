# Optimal-Portfolio-Construction

## Goal: 
The goal for this project is to optimize industry portfolios through maximizing Sharpe ratio or minimizing variance. 

## Project Approach:
* Step 1: Import Data from Kenneth French's Data Library
Gathered data from Kenneth French's data library, http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html.  
The Data Library contains current benchmark returns and historical benchmark returns data, which is convenient for financial modeling and data analysis. 
For this project specific, I used the 49 industry portfolios to answer a question: what is the strategy to allocate portfolios across 49 industries to generate highest Sharpe ratio or minimize variance?

* Step 2: Calculate the mean and variance of a portfolio
The return on the portfolio is the weighted sum of the individual stock returns


* Step 3: Portfolio Optimization Based on Maximum Sharpe Ratio
The Sharpe ratio of a portfolio (or security) is the ratio of the expected excess return of the portfolio to the portfolio's volatility. The Sharpe optimal portfolio is the portfolio with maximum Sharpe ratio.

** Scenario 1: For Long Only

** Scenario 2: Allow Short Selling

* Step 4: Portfolio Optimization Based on Minimum-Variance
